And this can be done by only feeding them with good prompts. <br /> Now you may ask, "What is the prompt ?!" Don't worry I got you covered. <br /> Prompt is the text with the help of which you communicate with the AI tools like chat GPT. <br /> You know what, sometimes it may get so hectic to write and engineer perfect prompts. So in order to tackle that I made this platform called 'GetPrompt'. <br /> Here you can search the prompts with the help of the keys. Have a good prompt that you want to share with other people and help them ? Share it o Get Prompt ! <br /> Now on the way, you start loving the work of some individual, just go ahead and follow him/her. <br /> Didn't found the key that you were looking for ? Go ahead and make one! But heres the catch, for making a new prompt topic you will have to have atleast 1 reputation. <br />
        Reputation can be gained by contributing more and more peompts to the platform. For every 5 contributions you will get 1 reputation. <br />
        So with that said let's go and have some funðŸ™Œ.</p>
